#


#
# This module contains the classes for running races to the requirements of
# Hill Head Sailing Club, Fareham, Hampshire www.hillheadsc.org.uk
#

#
# The over-riding design principle of the model is KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).
#
# To this end, despite the real time nature of running a race, the state of the
# objects in the model do not change in real time. A race has a startTime. This
# is a clock time, e.g. 1115. The countdown to or elapsed time from are calculated
# from the clock time. Races are managed by a RaceManager, which is similarly
# static.
#
# The model uses wx.lib.pubsub for the model to send events to listeners. The
# UIs can subscribe to
# events on Races and also the RaceManager. See
# http://wxpython.org/docs/api/wx.lib.pubsub-module.html
