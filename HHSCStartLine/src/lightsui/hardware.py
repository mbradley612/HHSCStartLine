EasyDayUSBRelay wraps an EasyDaq USB relay board. It has its own python thread for
managing itself.

17/04/2014 - issue 2 - changed EasyDaqUSBRelay to run in its own thread to isolate the IO
from the rest of the application. This means that the relay changes from an asynchronous model running on the Tk event loop to 
a synchronous model. The performance overhead is not an issue for this application. The interface to the relay becomes
a queue of command objects to change the state of the relay.
